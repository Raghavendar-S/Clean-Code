review 1 :
move all true logic to one block and have early return 
public bool IsShopOpen(string day)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(day))
    {
        return false;
    }
	
	var openingDays = new[] {"friday","saturday","sunday"};
	return openingDays.Any(d => d == day.toLower());
}

review 3:
move all magic variable to a const , eg set 50 as thresholdValue = 50 and follow early return if(n==0) return 0; then handle the logic in else block

review 4:
Use meaningful name to describe the list eg: cityList and the same goes for li , change it to listIndex and have declare variable close to their usage or pass the value directly to the funciton

review 5:
dont use magic value instead declare a const and use it

review 6:
Redundant usage of class name remove prefix of Car to the properties of class

review 9 :
Avoid Tight coupling 
Or Make Default value as string breweryName = "Hipster Brew Co."
